## Upwork Portfolio Paragraph + Highlights

### Portfolio Paragraph

Over the last sprint I built a production-ready automation spine that unifies daily work, AI, and dev tooling into a repeatable system. A one-command daily runner runs inside a controlled virtual environment and generates stakeholder-ready summaries; OpenAI is wired into GitHub Issues to create, label, and triage tasks from unstructured inputs. I hardened environment and repo hygiene so the framework is safe for external collaborators and easy to reapply to new projects—reducing manual synthesis time by approximately 30 minutes per day, creating a clear audit trail, and making handoffs to collaborators or investors safer and more reliable.

### Highlights (bullet points)

- One-command daily runner running in an isolated Python virtual environment
- AI-powered OpenAI ⇄ GitHub Issues pipeline for automatic issue creation, labeling, and triage
- Hardened repo structure and environment hygiene: clear entry points, `.env` guidance, and permission scoping
- Ready for investor/client demos: Vercel-deployable and documented local run steps
- Saves ~30 minutes per day of manual synthesis and task entry

### Case Study: Automation Spine & Daily Runner

**What was built**

A production-ready automation spine that unifies daily work, AI, and developer tooling into a single, repeatable system. The centerpiece is a one-command daily runner that executes inside a controlled virtual environment, pulls notes and data, and generates structured, stakeholder-ready summaries. On top of that, OpenAI is wired directly into GitHub Issues to automatically create, label, and triage tasks from unstructured inputs.

**Why it matters**

Manual synthesis and task entry consume roughly 30 minutes of every workday. This automation framework cuts that overhead, ensures nothing falls through the cracks, and creates a clear audit trail for collaborators and investors. The system is designed to be reapplied to new repos and workflows with minimal friction.

**Key capabilities**

- One-command entry point (run-daily.sh) inside a managed Python environment
- Automatic note summarization powered by OpenAI
- GitHub Issues auto-generated and triaged from raw inputs
- Environment and repo hygiene hardened for safe collaboration
- Deployable on Vercel or runnable locally with clear setup instructions
- Suitable for investor- and client-ready demos

**How it demonstrates automation engineering**

This project showcases end-to-end automation design: identifying bottleneck workflows, building a repeatable entry point, integrating AI for intelligence, wiring external APIs safely, and hardening everything for production handoff. The result is a system that scales from solo use to team collaboration without breaking.
